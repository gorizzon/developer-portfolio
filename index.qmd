Welcome to my digital home.

I'm a graduate student in applied statistics and aspiring data scientist.

Currently I study at Utrecht University, I'm doing my thesis at the Biostatistics and Data Science department of the Utrecht UMC, and I work at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences as a junior researcher in responsible IT (and, since last year, AI).

I like pretty graphs and statistics/math/data science memes, feel free to share something cool with me :)
