Hi there! I am Marta Sech, an italian 24-years-old master student at Utrecht University. I enjoy reading historical novels and watching sport on television: I am particular fan of Formula 1.

Curiosity moves me to explore new contexts and to immerse myself in unknown subjects outside my comfort zone. To achieve this, I really enjoy
collaborating with other people and feeling part of a group
directed towards a common goal.
