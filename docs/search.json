    "text": "I’m Giuliana Orizzonte, a graduate student in applied statistics based in Amsterdam. I’m currently in the final year of the Research Master Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical, and Social Sciences at Utrecht University, and I will graduate in June 2024.\nMy master thesis is on the use of Graph Neural Networks for patient classification and analysis of disease mechanisms. Outside of my studies, I work as a Junior Researcher at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences in the Responsible IT work group. Here, I’m involved in projects like an AI-based consensus machine and methods to de-bias algorithms during training, which allows me to combine my interest in statistics with a commitment to responsible technology that supports human wellbeing and development.\nI’m open to job opportunities in data science, machine learning, and beyond, always looking to apply my skills in meaningful and impactful ways.\nIn my free time I read, go to concerts, ponder over the meaning(lessness) of life, and play board games. My favorite author is Saramago, my favorite concert was New Order, my favorite philosophical theory is Absurdism, and the jury is still out on my favorite game."

    "text": "Work Experience\n\nOctober 2022 - ongoing: Junior Researcher Responsible IT and Responsible AI, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences\nI contribute to finding and creating solutions to integrate responsibility and trustworthiness in technology and artificial intelligence. Each year, the team works on specific projects, often in cooperation with companies or social organizations located in the Netherlands. We also contribute to the academic programs offered by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. In 2023, I worked on an AI-based consensus machine and a method to de-bias algorithms during training using counterfactuals and Bayesian inference.\nOctober 2022 - ongoing: Research Assistant Methodology and Statistics, Utrecht University\nI support Dr. K.M. Meitinger in her academic research projects. In the past year, my work included the following: preparing a report on the viability and reliability of using home testing kits for water quality in a citizen science project led by the Dutch Bureau of Statistics, writing a literature review on the use of paradata to assess measurement equivalence, and integrating voice recordings in survey design. In the summer of 2023, I also worked as a research assistant for Dr. R.M. Kuiper, for whom I created tutorials demonstrating how to use the R package `restriktor`, which implements functions to calculate the GORIC(A) information criterion and perform Evidence Synthesis.\nAugust 2023: Teaching Assistant Applied Multivariate Analysis, Utrecht Summer School\nI conducted labs, discussion meetings, and quizzes to facilitate and reinforce students' learning of statistical techniques ranging from simple T-tests to Principal Component Analysis. The course was taught by Dr. D.J. Hessen and is intended to serve as both a revision and further study for graduate students and Ph.D. researchers."
