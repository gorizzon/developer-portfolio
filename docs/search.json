    "text": "Hi there! I am Marta Sech, an italian 24-years-old master student at Utrecht University. I enjoy reading historical novels and watching sport on television: I am particular fan of Formula 1.\nCuriosity moves me to explore new contexts and to immerse myself in unknown subjects outside my comfort zone. To achieve this, I really enjoy collaborating with other people and feeling part of a group directed towards a common goal."
